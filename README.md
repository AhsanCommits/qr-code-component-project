## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

During the process of working on this project, I gained several key learnings:

1. Semantic HTML Markup: I reinforced the importance of using semantic HTML tags to improve accessibility and maintainable code structure. For example, I utilized `<main>`, `<footer>`, and other semantic tags appropriately in this project.

2. CSS Flexbox: The `display: flex` property along with the `justify-content` and `align-items` properties helped me create the centered and responsive design in this project.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on:

1. Responsive Design
2. JavaScript Frameworks
3. Performance Optimization
4. Accessibility
5. Testing and Debugging
